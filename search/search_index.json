In Norse mythology, \u00c1sbr\u00fa refers to a burning rainbow bridge that connects Midgard (Earth) and Asgard, the realm of the gods. Is this a fork of PAC (Perl Auto Connector) Manager ? Yes. As David Torrejon Vaquerizas , the author of PAC Manager, could not find time, for some reasons that we respect, to continue the work on his project and was not open for external contributions ( see this ), a fork was needed to ensure the future and give the opportunity to the community to take over.

Please chose the best option for your environement, in this example, we will assume the following choices: Would you like to configure as much as possible automatically? --> yes What approach do you want? --> sudo 3) In the CPAN shell, install Gnome2::Vte cpan[1] > install Gnome2::Vte This will download the latest version (0.11), compile it and install it under /usr/local/lib . 4) Cleaning up: (those steps are optional, think carefully about your own environment ! This may potentially break your system. You have been warned ) If you don't need the development packages anymore: sudo apt purge libvte-dev sudo apt autoremove If it was the first time you used CPAN and you don't want to keep .cpan configuration, sources, etc. rm -rf .cpan","title":"Installation"},{"location":"General/Installation/#how-can-i-install-asbru-connection-manager","text":"\u00c1sbr\u00fa Connection Manager is packaged for a large range of distributions.

It helps you to automate a login sequence and a continuous set of actions. But they do not work after the complete login sequence ends. \u00c1sbr\u00fa is not constantly monitoring your typing, so as soon as the login process ends, and the last expect is executed, there will be no more expect detection an execution. You must know how to write regular expressions for this to work properly. There are several regular expressions in different parts of the General Preferences and Connection Preferences that allows you to control the login sequence. Introduction to user, password, prompt sequence. \u00b6 These are the must important configuration regular expressions that will automate your login sequence. Global Preferences > Main Options > Advanced Settings \u00b6 PASSWORD prompt : Regular expression that will detect your password prompt When found will type your terminal password or passphrase for you. Regex : (?mi)(pass(word|phrase)|contrase\u00f1a).*?:\\s*$ USERNAME prompt : Regular expression that will detect your username prompt When found will type your terminal username for you. Regex : ([lL]ogin|[uU]suario|([uU]ser-?)*[nN]ame.*|[uU]ser)\\s*:\\s*$ Command prompt : Regular expression that will detect your command prompt When found the automated login will pass actions to your configured Expects for the terminal (if there are any configured) Regex : [#%\\$>]|\\:\\/\\s*$ Remote host key changed : Regular expression that will detect when the process detected a change in the remote host key. When found, the terminal will issue the add and accept sequence and continue. Regex : .*ffending .*key in (.+?)\\:(\\d+).* Host-key verification string : Regular expression that will detect you are connecting to a new server and to accept the remote key automatically. Regex : ^.+ontinue connecting \\(([^/]+)\\/([^/]+)(?:[^)]+)?\\)\\?\\s*$ Press any key to continue : Regular expression that will detect a press any key to continue and send a new line for you. Regex : .*(any key to continue|tecla para continuar).* Terminal Options \u00b6 You can override some of the previous regular expressions for a particular terminal if they do not work well on a particular connection. Is recommended to use a terminal override when the expression you want to add is not common to all your connections or it makes your global option fail if you combine them with the more general one. To override the global options on a certain connection activate the Use these personal options in your terminal options tab. The meaning of this options are identical to the global options. Expect Tab in the terminal configuration \u00b6 You may add additional expects to your login sequence with this option. Each expect will be executed in sequence, one by one. The first one to match will \"send\" the configured sequence of characters to the terminal. In the example above the sequence would be: Wait for a command prompt with the simbol ~ Then send to the terminal : ssh otherbox Wait then for a string : username Then send : myuser Then wait for : password Then send the string : otherboxpass This could automate, login to a server, then ssh into another one from this one. General sequence of events \u00b6 Connection Starts Expect waits for any of the predefined sequence. Wait for any of: key change, new key, password, username, prompt If we do not get a prompt command or have a timeout during the login process DISCONNECT If we have a prompt, continue Execute user defined EXPECT until timeout, o no more expects detected.

See issue #473 In this case the admin at the host decided that the prompt should have this non standard format: [hostname:userid:/home/userid:] So the prompt regex for that particular connection had to be changed to : :\\]\\s+$ Debug your expects If your expects do not work as expected, then you must debug your regular expressions to understand why did not work.

Instead, it will do the following actions: SSH into the jump server Send an SSH connection string based on your connection settings Important for this to work Because the connection now is stablished in the Jump Server any keys, hostnames, etc. Has to be available in the Jump server environment for the destination connection to take place. So if you use a private key in your server, you need to provide the key in the destination server. And the path to that key has to be the connection. Because the keys are selected locally in your computer, you need to have the same key and path in the destination server. Or to easy the situation, create an entry in the on user ssh config file ~/ssh/.config with the corresponding paths to your key and the user name. And use the connection name as your Host name. (Pre / Post) Exec \u00b6 This commands will be executed immediately before (Pre) the connection is launched. And after (Post) the connection has been closed .

When you are connected to a remote server, the remote application could request and process mouse events or not. If the remote application does not process any mouse events, then the local terminal processes this mouse events locally. To distinguish if the remote application is processing mouse events, look at the mouse pointer shape. When a remote program is not processing mouse events then the mouse pointer is a text caret. No mouse processing Mouse processing The mouse pointer looks as your default pointer. Local Clipboard A local selection creates copies to your local clipboard , not to the remote clipboard. This will let you paste the text in some local application (text editor, IDE, etc.) Remote application does NOT process mouse events. \u00b6 double click : The terminal will select a \"word\" on the \"visible\" text of the terminal. The characters used as a word are [a-Z_] plus any additional characters that you configured in rule described in the Main options Advanced Tab : Select by word characters . triple click : The terminal will select the \"visible\" row of text of the terminal. Click and drag : The terminal will select the text from the start point of the mouse drag to the end point in a complete sequence, jumping lines and start from the beginning of the next new line. <Shift + Ctrl> + drag : Will create a square selection from the starting drag point to the end.

Which means you will have to reconfigure the usernames and passwords fields. Or run a helper migration application if available. The current integration uses keepassxc-cli to access the database, https://keepassxc.org/ . To see the reasons for this hard changes, please read at the end of this documentation page. KeePass Organization \u00b6 It is very important to prepare your KeePass database to work with this integration. The database access is done using the command line tool keepassxc-cli And by design this tool imposes certain restrictions. All paths must be unique to be able to retrieve the correct user name and password at the time of the connection The cli will not allow to search by uuid , so the only search pattern that guaranties unique entries is the full path to the key This means that you must organize your data in groups and subgroups to guaranty unique paths at the time of configuration. To explain this better, lets look at the following images. You have this password organization In keepass, you can visually tell what is the entry you are interested in, by looking at the relationship of Group:Title:Username But when using the CLI, we only have access to Group:Title, and a listing of entries would look like this. This brings 2 problems We do not know which entry we want. Later when \u00c1sbr\u00fa wants to pull the user name and password during a connection, keepassxc-cli will pull the first entry found, it will not return all the entries. So the CLI will not know which entry we want either. So, you must make sure all your entries are unique : Group:Subgroup:..:Title You can use any technique you like, this are some recommendations of organizations that can produce unique paths. /Group/hostname /Group/Subgroup/hostname /Group/Service/hostname /Group/Location/hostname Example of unique titles Search result. Another alternative, with subgroups List Configure \u00b6 Activate use of KeePass database file : Activate KeePass functionality. Database file : Select the location of your database. Master Password : This field is optional. If provided, the password will be stored in the asbry.yml file for convenience so you do not need to type it. If left blank. \u00c1sbr\u00fa will ask for the password the first time is needed, and then retain in memory for the remaining of the \u00c1sbr\u00fa session. Key file : If your version of keypassxc-cli supports it, and you have configured your database to use a keyfile, then selected here. keepassxc-cli binary : you can choose a different keepassxc-cli binary to use. In case you have installed for your user only or want to use a different version available in your system. On every change the application will validate the existence and capabilities of the selected version. Clear buttons : Remove any previously selected file. Info : \u00c1sbr\u00fa, will show the current keepassxc-cli version and the capabilities detected in your current version. If no keepassxc-cli detected, install keepassxc package to have it available. If some capabilities are not present, it means you may have to upgrade your keepassxc version. How to use \u00b6 Enter Master Password \u00b6 If you decided not to save the Master Password, when access to the database is needed you will see a prompt similar to this one. Type your password and clic on \"Accept\". If the application can not unlock the database will prompt again. You can type cancel if you do not want to unlock the database, or the password you are entering is not working. Assign a user name and password to a connection. \u00b6 Click on the \"KeyPass\" icon to open the KeePassXC search, this window will allow you to search keepass entries and list the results. Locate the entry you want to use as a reference and then double click on that entry. After the double click the link to your username and password will be assigned to the active authentication method selected in the configuration tab. Recommendations KeyPass pattern : The pattern is formed as : <keepass_property|keepass entry path> . You can edit and change the text to any valid property and path if your need. Current properties available from keepassxc-cli : username, password, title, url, notes I selected the wrong authentication method before selecting my keepass link. Simply copy paste the entries to your the correct fields, or change the method and select your entry again. Assign URL, or other properties to other fields \u00b6 Some fields gives you access to keepass list search to add an entry to : expects, variables, local commands, etc. Known restriction or limitations of the current model. \u00b6 This are known limitations of the current model. The cli access will not allow to have an \"unlocked\" state. It could be accomplished by opening an interactive session. But this would introduce the need to replicate most of the logic in keepassxc-browser integration (create a service). Which is quite extensive, and in this case would make no sense to replicate existing work, would be better to implement the browser integration client. The cli , offers a very clean, easy and safe access that decouples \u00c1sbr\u00fa from becoming a security target for command injections, etc. The main impact is visible if you decide to setup a keepass database with version 4+ and add a very strong encryption. This will create a delay of up to 5 seconds to unlock the database on every connection. Is your decision to balance the time to unlock and level of encryption If you are willing to wait the 5 seconds of unlock time for a connection then is OK, you decide. Why don't you implement the browser integration? Perhaps in the future it could be possible. And the current implementation would be ready to do so. But as of this date (2020-03-12), the \u00c1sbr\u00fa project, is still recovering from the hard migration to gkt3 and there are many features and stability issues that need to be addressed. This was the must balanced path to deliver a good integration and attend all other issues. Why did you have to rewrite and brake compatibility? \u00b6 The functionality was completely rewritten to address several related requests and additional issues detected in the previous implementation. Current Implementation Is no longer required to save the database Master Password inside \u00c1sbr\u00fa configuration files. If password is not stored, it will ask for it when needed only once, and saved in memory for the current \u00c1sbr\u00fa session. User names and passwords are retrieved from database on the fly at the moment of connection. You can change your passwords in your database and in the next connection the new one will be used. No unencrypted passwords, users, database are retained in memory or files any more. User name and passwords are references now. KeePass Url entry, can be used as a reference to get the host to connect to. User has complete control over what \u00c1sbr\u00fa should access and not. User can migrate databases versions freely without any need to wait for \u00c1sbr\u00fa to catch up. Users can use a keyfile to unlock the database. Linking keepass users and password to entry paths guaranties a 1 to 1 match. Decouple \u00c1sbr\u00fa from any responsibility to access the database directly, making it more secure for the end user. Previous Implementation issues Would extract absolutely all passwords even when they were not related to any connection , pulling out any other information that a user could have stored like : bank accounts, credit card nips, etc. The full information, was completely cached inside \u00c1sbr\u00fa. This also lead to the need to manually \"Reload\" the database when changes in keepass were made. If hundreds of entries The full password list was located in a long popup submenu. Very difficult to follow and select. Slow database reload. \u00c1sbr\u00fa would look as it freezed. Slow start ups. Some entries could return more than one match and the user would be required to choose the correct one during logins. The database was accessed directly with a library The library had to be maintained if the database encryption algorithms changed. Use of keyfile had to be implemented in the library to be able to use.","title":"KeePass"},{"location":"Manual/Preferences/KeePassXC/#keepass-integration","text":"Important This documentation corresponds to \u00c1sbr\u00fa 6.2+ This new integration breaks compatibility with stored users and passwords of previous \u00c1sbr\u00fa versions .
