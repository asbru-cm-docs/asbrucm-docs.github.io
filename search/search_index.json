Please chose the best option for your environement, in this example, we will assume the following choices: ```` Would you like to configure as much as possible automatically? -- yes What approach do you want? -- sudo ```` 3) In the CPAN shell, install Gnome2::Vte ```` cpan[1] install Gnome2::Vte ```` This will download the latest version (0.11), compile it and install it under /usr/local/lib. 4) Cleaning up: (those steps are optional, think carefully about your own environment ! This may potentially break your system. **You have been warned**) If you don't need the development packages anymore: ```` $ sudo apt purge libvte-dev $ sudo apt autoremove ```` If it was the first time you used CPAN and you don't want to keep .cpan configuration, sources, etc. ```` $ rm -rf .cpan ````","title":"Installation"},{"location":"General/Installation/#ubuntu","text":"","title":"Ubuntu"},{"location":"General/Installation/#latest-release","text":"To install the latest release on a fresh Ubuntu system, use the following instructions: sudo apt-add-repository multiverse sudo apt install curl curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/asbru-cm/asbru-cm/script.deb.sh | sudo bash sudo apt install asbru-cm","title":"Latest release"},{"location":"General/Installation/#snapshot-release","text":"To install the latest development snapshot, use the following instructions: sudo apt-add-repository multiverse sudo apt install curl curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/asbru-cm/asbru-cm/script.deb.sh | sudo bash curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/asbru-cm/snapshots/script.deb.sh | sudo bash sudo apt install asbru-cm","title":"Snapshot release"},{"location":"General/Installation/#mint","text":"","title":"Mint"},{"location":"General/Installation/#latest-release_1","text":"To install the latest release on a fresh Mint system, use the following instructions: curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/asbru-cm/asbru-cm/script.deb.sh | sudo bash sudo apt install asbru-cm","title":"Latest release"},{"location":"General/Installation/#snapshot-release_1","text":"To install the latest development snapshot, use the following instructions: curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/asbru-cm/asbru-cm/script.deb.sh | sudo bash curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/asbru-cm/snapshots/script.deb.sh | sudo bash sudo apt install asbru-cm","title":"Snapshot release"},{"location":"General/Installation/#debian","text":"","title":"Debian"},{"location":"General/Installation/#latest-release_2","text":"To install the latest release on a fresh Debian system, use the following instructions: sudo apt update sudo apt install curl curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/asbru-cm/asbru-cm/script.deb.sh | sudo bash sudo apt install asbru-cm","title":"Latest release"},{"location":"General/Installation/#snapshot-release_2","text":"To install the latest development snapshot, use the following instructions: sudo apt update sudo apt install curl curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/asbru-cm/asbru-cm/script.deb.sh | sudo bash curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/asbru-cm/snapshots/script.deb.sh | sudo bash sudo apt install asbru-cm","title":"Snapshot release"},{"location":"General/Installation/#fedora","text":"","title":"Fedora"},{"location":"General/Installation/#latest-release_3","text":"To install the latest release on a fresh Fedora system, use the following instructions: curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/asbru-cm/asbru-cm/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash sudo dnf install asbru-cm","title":"Latest release"},{"location":"General/Installation/#snapshot-release_3","text":"To install the latest development snapshot, use the following instructions: curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/asbru-cm/snapshots/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash sudo dnf install asbru-cm","title":"Snapshot release"},{"location":"General/Installation/#testing-new-features","text":"Our master and the snapshots are being kept as stable as possible.

This is more an admin tool than programmers, you can use it to type common commands to servers that are identical or at least very similar, this allows you to: update several servers edit a config file on all of them at the same time From a programmer point of view As an example, I program remote Raspeberri Pi that are connected to electronic scales, etc. And have a very unique code that is similar across them, but I do not have a development environment because I do not have the interest in buying expensive scales or robot arms, to be able to develop. So I connect to all of them simultaneously, they all have exactly the same code; then I edit the code on one terminal and I'm patching on real time the others. Of course I could work on one and then copy the file to the others, but for small adjustments this has been always more practical.

You must know how to write regular expressions for this to work properly. There are several regular expressions in different parts of the General Preferences and Connection Preferences that allows you to control the login sequence. Introduction to user, password, prompt sequence. These are the must important configuration regular expressions that will automate your login sequence. Global Preferences Main Options Advanced Settings PASSWORD prompt : Regular expression that will detect your password prompt When found will type your terminal password or passphrase for you. USERNAME prompt : Regular expression that will detect your username prompt When found will type your terminal username for you. Command prompt : Regular expression that will detect your command prompt When found the automated login will pass actions to your configured Expects for the terminal (if there are any configured) Remote host key changed : Regular expression that will detect when the process detected a change in the remote host key. When found, the terminal will issue the add and accept sequence and continue. Host-key verification string : Regular expression that will detect you are connecting to a new server and to accept the remote key automatically. Press any key to continue : Regular expression that will detect a press any key to continue and send a new line for you. Terminal Options You can override some of the previous regular expressions for a particular terminal if they do not work well on a particular connection.

To override the global options on a certain connection activate the Use these personal options in your terminal options tab. The meaning of this options are identical to the global options. Expect Tab in the terminal configuration You may add additional expects to your login sequence with this option. Each expect will be executed in sequence, one by one. The first one to match will \"send\" the configured sequence of characters to the terminal. In the example above the sequence would be: Wait for a command prompt with the simbol ~ Then send to the terminal : ssh otherbox Wait then for a string : username Then send : myuser Then wait for : password Then send the string : otherboxpass This could automate, login to a server, then ssh into another one from this one.

If you have configured your connection not to have a saved password, you will receive a popup window requesting you to type your password. Expired passwords and change password required In this cases you may see additional popup windows for each password requested: password, original password, new password, confirmation password. If you have problems to complete an expired password process, because the expect regex do not work well for you. Edit the connection and set it to Manual Save Open the connection and complete the login sequence manually Mouse Interaction \u00c1sbr\u00fa uses the gnome vte library, and is a mouse driven terminal. Copy / Paste We will begin explaining the concept of copy paste in the terminal, because is the one that confuses many users. When you are connected to a remote server, the remote application could request and process mouse events or not. If the remote application does not process any mouse events, then the local terminal processes this mouse events locally. To distinguish if the remote application is processing mouse events, look at the cursor shape. When a remote program is not processing mouse events then the cursor is a text caret. No mouse processing Mouse processing Local Clipboard A local selection creates copies to your local clipboard , not to the remote clipboard. This will let you paste the text in some local application (text editor, IDE, etc.) Remote application does NOT process mouse events. double click : The terminal will select a \"word\" on the \"visible\" text of the terminal. The characters used as a word are [a-Z_] plus any additional characters that you configured in rule described in the Main options Advanced Tab : Select by word characters . triple click : The terminal will select the \"visible\" row of text of the terminal. Click and drag : The terminal will select the text from the start point of the mouse drag to the end point in a complete sequence, jumping lines and start from the beginning of the next new line. Shift + Ctrl + drag : Will create a square selection from the starting drag point to the end. Copy / Paste As soon as you select the text and release the mouse, the selected text is copied to the clipboard without any further actions (no need to : right-click Copy , crtl-c ) To paste your text into another application Ctrl-V To paste text from your local clipboard into the terminal. Shift + Insert or right clic Paste . You can imagine that the \"Paste action\", is similar to sending all the characters in the buffer to the terminal. So they will be sent with all the existing tabs, new line characters, etc. The terminal is a canvas The terminal has no knowledge of the remote application, so when selecting and copying, it selects the text that finds on the visible area, and treats it as a canvas (a paintable area). Do not expect the terminal to know that there are : line numbers or drawing characters to ignore, it will copy all the text under the selection. Remote application does process mouse events. Depending on the remote application, the selection process would look and feel different : + could be very slow + or that the selection is shown after releasing the mouse + or that the highlight is delayed. Example of a remote double and triple click selection Selected text When the selection and copy actions take place, they are located in the remote application clipboard, not on your local clipboard. To be able to use the terminal actions described above. You will have to use the Shift key during your mouse operations to instruct the terminal \"not to pass the mouse event to the remote program\". Common problems of copy paste text from terminal to local application Copy / Paste from editor copies line numbers Solution Use the square selection technique, or hide the number panel in your editor before copying.

The current integration uses keepassxc-cli to access the database, https://keepassxc.org/ . To see the reasons for this hard changes, please read at the end of this documentation page. KeePass Organization It is very important to prepare your KeePass database to work with this integration. The database access is done using the command line tool keepassxc-cli And by design this tool imposes certain restrictions. All paths must be unique to be able to retrieve the correct user name and password at the time of the connection The cli will not allow to search by uuid , so the only search pattern that guaranties unique entries is the full path to the key This means that you must organize your data in groups and subgroups to guaranty unique paths at the time of configuration. To explain this better, lets look at the following images. You have this password organization In keepass, you can visually tell what is the entry you are interested in, by looking at the relationship of Group:Title:Username But when using the CLI, we only have access to Group:Title, and a listing of entries would look like this. This brings 2 problems We do not know which entry we want. Later when \u00c1sbr\u00fa wants to pull the user name and password during a connection, keepassxc-cli will pull the first entry found, it will not return all the entries. So the CLI will not know which entry we want either. So, you must make sure all your entries are unique : Group:Subgroup:..:Title You can use any technique you like, this are some recommendations of organizations that can produce unique paths. /Group/hostname /Group/Subgroup/hostname /Group/Service/hostname /Group/Location/hostname Example of unique titles Search result.

Key file : If your version of keypassxc-cli supports it, and you have configured your database to use a keyfile, then selected here. keepassxc-cli binary : you can choose a different keepassxc-cli binary to use. In case you have installed for your user only or want to use a different version available in your system. On every change the application will validate the existence and capabilities of the selected version. Clear buttons : Remove any previously selected file. Info : \u00c1sbr\u00fa, will show the current keepassxc-cli version and the capabilities detected in your current version. If no keepassxc-cli detected, install keepassxc package to have it available. If some capabilities are not present, it means you may have to upgrade your keepassxc version. How to use Enter Master Password If you decided not to save the Master Password, when access to the database is needed you will see a prompt similar to this one. Type your password and clic on \"Accept\". If the application can not unlock the database will prompt again. You can type cancel if you do not want to unlock the database, or the password you are entering is not working. Assign a user name and password to a connection. Click on the \"KeyPass\" icon to open the KeePassXC search, this window will allow you to search keepass entries and list the results.

This are known limitations of the current model. The cli access will not allow to have an \"unlocked\" state. It could be accomplished by opening an interactive session. But this would introduce the need to replicate most of the logic in keepassxc-browser integration (create a service). Which is quite extensive, and in this case would make no sense to replicate existing work, would be better to implement the browser integration client. The cli , offers a very clean, easy and safe access that decouples \u00c1sbr\u00fa from becoming a security target for command injections, etc. The main impact is visible if you decide to setup a keepass database with version 4+ and add a very strong encryption. This will create a delay of up to 5 seconds to unlock the database on every connection. Is your decision to balance the time to unlock and level of encryption If you are willing to wait the 5 seconds of unlock time for a connection then is OK, you decide. Why don't you implement the browser integration? Perhaps in the future it could be possible. And the current implementation would be ready to do so. But as of this date (2020-03-12), the \u00c1sbr\u00fa project, is still recovering from the hard migration to gkt3 and there are many features and stability issues that need to be addressed. This was the must balanced path to deliver a good integration and attend all other issues. Why did you have to rewrite and brake compatibility? The functionality was completely rewritten to address several related requests and additional issues detected in the previous implementation. Current Implementation Is no longer required to save the database Master Password inside \u00c1sbr\u00fa configuration files. If password is not stored, it will ask for it when needed only once, and saved in memory for the current \u00c1sbr\u00fa session. User names and passwords are retrieved from database on the fly at the moment of connection. You can change your passwords in your database and in the next connection the new one will be used. No unencrypted passwords, users, database are retained in memory or files any more. User name and passwords are references now. KeePass Url entry, can be used as a reference to get the host to connect to. User has complete control over what \u00c1sbr\u00fa should access and not. User can migrate databases versions freely without any need to wait for \u00c1sbr\u00fa to catch up. Users can use a keyfile to unlock the database. Linking keepass users and password to entry paths guaranties a 1 to 1 match. Decouple \u00c1sbr\u00fa from any responsibility to access the database directly, making it more secure for the end user.
