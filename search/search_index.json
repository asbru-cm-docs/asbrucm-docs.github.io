Please chose the best option for your environement, in this example, we will assume the following choices: ```` Would you like to configure as much as possible automatically? --> yes What approach do you want? --> sudo ```` 3) In the CPAN shell, install Gnome2::Vte ```` cpan[1] > install Gnome2::Vte ```` This will download the latest version (0.11), compile it and install it under /usr/local/lib. 4) Cleaning up: (those steps are optional, think carefully about your own environment ! This may potentially break your system. **You have been warned**) If you don't need the development packages anymore: ```` $ sudo apt purge libvte-dev $ sudo apt autoremove ```` If it was the first time you used CPAN and you don't want to keep .cpan configuration, sources, etc. ```` $ rm -rf .cpan ````","title":"Installation"},{"location":"General/Installation/#ubuntu","text":"","title":"Ubuntu"},{"location":"General/Installation/#latest-release","text":"To install the latest release on a fresh Ubuntu system, use the following instructions: sudo apt-add-repository multiverse sudo apt install curl curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/asbru-cm/asbru-cm/script.deb.sh | sudo bash sudo apt install asbru-cm","title":"Latest release"},{"location":"General/Installation/#snapshot-release","text":"To install the latest development snapshot, use the following instructions: sudo apt-add-repository multiverse sudo apt install curl curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/asbru-cm/asbru-cm/script.deb.sh | sudo bash curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/asbru-cm/snapshots/script.deb.sh | sudo bash sudo apt install asbru-cm","title":"Snapshot release"},{"location":"General/Installation/#mint","text":"","title":"Mint"},{"location":"General/Installation/#latest-release_1","text":"To install the latest release on a fresh Mint system, use the following instructions: curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/asbru-cm/asbru-cm/script.deb.sh | sudo bash sudo apt install asbru-cm","title":"Latest release"},{"location":"General/Installation/#snapshot-release_1","text":"To install the latest development snapshot, use the following instructions: curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/asbru-cm/asbru-cm/script.deb.sh | sudo bash curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/asbru-cm/snapshots/script.deb.sh | sudo bash sudo apt install asbru-cm","title":"Snapshot release"},{"location":"General/Installation/#debian","text":"","title":"Debian"},{"location":"General/Installation/#latest-release_2","text":"To install the latest release on a fresh Debian system, use the following instructions: sudo apt update sudo apt install curl curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/asbru-cm/asbru-cm/script.deb.sh | sudo bash sudo apt install asbru-cm","title":"Latest release"},{"location":"General/Installation/#snapshot-release_2","text":"To install the latest development snapshot, use the following instructions: sudo apt update sudo apt install curl curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/asbru-cm/asbru-cm/script.deb.sh | sudo bash curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/asbru-cm/snapshots/script.deb.sh | sudo bash sudo apt install asbru-cm","title":"Snapshot release"},{"location":"General/Installation/#fedora","text":"","title":"Fedora"},{"location":"General/Installation/#latest-release_3","text":"To install the latest release on a fresh Fedora system, use the following instructions: curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/asbru-cm/asbru-cm/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash sudo dnf install asbru-cm","title":"Latest release"},{"location":"General/Installation/#snapshot-release_3","text":"To install the latest development snapshot, use the following instructions: curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/asbru-cm/snapshots/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash sudo dnf install asbru-cm","title":"Snapshot release"},{"location":"General/Installation/#testing-new-features","text":"Our master and the snapshots are being kept as stable as possible.

This change is related to #182 and will basically rename the default configuration file from ~/.config/pac to ~/.config/asbru to move forward in the rebranding of the forked application. As of version 6.2.0, that is under testing in our \"loki\" branch , you will be required to migrate your existing configuration to the new file layout. At application startup, a warning message will give you the opportunity to think twice about it. We believe we did everything to make this as smooth and transparent as possible. But what you may want to understand: Nothing will be lost A safe copy of your existing configuration will be done to ~/.config/pac.old Older versions of \u00c1sbr\u00fa will not be able to read that new configuration When starting an old version (6.0 or higher), you can use --config-dir ~/.config/pac.old to use your old configuration When starting an old version (6.1.x), \u00c1sbr\u00fa will propose to downgrade your migrated configuration or recover your old configuration Upgrade and downgrade scripts are available in the utils directory Please comme issue #569 if you have any concern with this change ; or simply thumb it up if you understand what will happen in the next days and are ready to test this to ensure a proper release of 6.2.0. Happy Easter testing ! 15.02.2020 Dear testers, We have merged the codebase for version 6.1.0 into master. This release will bring some cleanups and a few new features which require testing. These new features are: Support for SOCKS Proxy (for VNC/RDP/SSH/SFTP today) using ncat for advanced cases Support for Jump Host to simplify SSH tunneling for VNC/RDP/SSH connections. We would be happy if you can test the master snapshots as we would like to release the first official rc1 build soon. Attention: please make sure you have a safe copy of your configuration directory (which is ~/.config/pac) by default before proceeding with your tests.

Important The terminal interaction and login will be frozen until the external application is finished. Or is demonized. Example, before launching the terminal start a local apache server After closing the terminal, execute pdfshufler Execution examples, with a gtk application to see the results. Pre exec is configured to ask, is waiting for you to execute an available command from the list. Application is launched and the terminal waits for the end of the execution. We exit the terminal, the terminal is closed and the post exec command is executed. Possible uses Launch : an IDE, a Database Client (DBeaver), start a local scripts that uploads or downloads files, etc. Expect You can create and execute a sequence of automated actions that will be executed during your login process. Expect : Regular expression that defines what patter to wait from the terminal. Timeout : How long to wait for the pattern and abort if it does not presents. Send : When the pattern has a match, send the next sequence of characters. Return : Add a CR at the end of the string. Hide : If the content of this box should be treated as a password field. Hide visual information for peering eyes. On MATCH / Fail : Execute the next Expect #number in case of MATCH or Fail. Delete : Remove the selected rule. Executed during the login process only This expect actions take place only during the login process. It helps you to automate a login sequence and a continuous set of actions. But they do not work after the complete login sequence ends. \u00c1sbr\u00fa is not constantly monitoring your typing, so as soon as the login process ends, and the last expect is executed, there will be no more expect detection an execution.

Copy / Paste We will begin explaining the concept of copy paste in the terminal, because is the one that confuses many users. When you are connected to a remote server, the remote application could request and process mouse events or not. If the remote application does not process any mouse events, then the local terminal processes this mouse events locally. To distinguish if the remote application is processing mouse events, look at the cursor shape. When a remote program is not processing mouse events then the cursor is a text caret. No mouse processing Mouse processing Local Clipboard A local selection creates copies to your local clipboard , not to the remote clipboard. This will let you paste the text in some local application (text editor, IDE, etc.) Remote application does NOT process mouse events. double click : The terminal will select a \"word\" on the \"visible\" text of the terminal. The characters used as a word are [a-Z_] plus any additional characters that you configured in rule described in the Main options Advanced Tab : Select by word characters . triple click : The terminal will select the \"visible\" row of text of the terminal. Click and drag : The terminal will select the text from the start point of the mouse drag to the end point in a complete sequence, jumping lines and start from the beginning of the next new line. <Shift + Ctrl> + drag : Will create a square selection from the starting drag point to the end. Copy / Paste As soon as you select the text and release the mouse, the selected text is copied to the clipboard without any further actions (no need to : right-click > Copy , <crtl-c> ) To paste your text into another application <Ctrl-V> To paste text from your local clipboard into the terminal. <Shift + Insert> or right clic > Paste . You can imagine that the \"Paste action\", is similar to sending all the characters in the buffer to the terminal.

Which means you will have to reconfigure the usernames and passwords fields. Or run a helper migration application if available. The current integration uses keepassxc-cli to access the database, https://keepassxc.org/ . To see the reasons for this hard changes, please read at the end of this documentation page. KeePass Organization It is very important to prepare your KeePass database to work with this integration. The database access is done using the command line tool keepassxc-cli And by design this tool imposes certain restrictions. All paths must be unique to be able to retrieve the correct user name and password at the time of the connection The cli will not allow to search by uuid , so the only search pattern that guaranties unique entries is the full path to the key This means that you must organize your data in groups and subgroups to guaranty unique paths at the time of configuration. To explain this better, lets look at the following images. You have this password organization In keepass, you can visually tell what is the entry you are interested in, by looking at the relationship of Group:Title:Username But when using the CLI, we only have access to Group:Title, and a listing of entries would look like this. This brings 2 problems We do not know which entry we want. Later when \u00c1sbr\u00fa wants to pull the user name and password during a connection, keepassxc-cli will pull the first entry found, it will not return all the entries. So the CLI will not know which entry we want either. So, you must make sure all your entries are unique : Group:Subgroup:..:Title You can use any technique you like, this are some recommendations of organizations that can produce unique paths. /Group/hostname /Group/Subgroup/hostname /Group/Service/hostname /Group/Location/hostname Example of unique titles Search result. Another alternative, with subgroups List Configure Activate use of KeePass database file : Activate KeePass functionality. Database file : Select the location of your database. Master Password : This field is optional. If provided, the password will be stored in the pac.yml file for convenience so you do not need to type it. If left blank. \u00c1sbr\u00fa will ask for the password the first time is needed, and then retain in memory for the remaining of the \u00c1sbr\u00fa session. Key file : If your version of keypassxc-cli supports it, and you have configured your database to use a keyfile, then selected here. keepassxc-cli binary : you can choose a different keepassxc-cli binary to use. In case you have installed for your user only or want to use a different version available in your system. On every change the application will validate the existence and capabilities of the selected version. Clear buttons : Remove any previously selected file. Info : \u00c1sbr\u00fa, will show the current keepassxc-cli version and the capabilities detected in your current version. If no keepassxc-cli detected, install keepassxc package to have it available. If some capabilities are not present, it means you may have to upgrade your keepassxc version. How to use Enter Master Password If you decided not to save the Master Password, when access to the database is needed you will see a prompt similar to this one. Type your password and clic on \"Accept\". If the application can not unlock the database will prompt again. You can type cancel if you do not want to unlock the database, or the password you are entering is not working. Assign a user name and password to a connection. Click on the \"KeyPass\" icon to open the KeePassXC search, this window will allow you to search keepass entries and list the results. Locate the entry you want to use as a reference and then double click on that entry. After the double click the link to your username and password will be assigned to the active authentication method selected in the configuration tab. Recommendations KeyPass pattern : The pattern is formed as : <keepass_property|keepass entry path> . You can edit and change the text to any valid property and path if your need. Current properties available from keepassxc-cli : username, password, title, url, notes I selected the wrong authentication method before selecting my keepass link. Simply copy paste the entries to your the correct fields, or change the method and select your entry again. Assign URL, or other properties to other fields Some fields gives you access to keepass list search to add an entry to : expects, variables, local commands, etc. Known restriction or limitations of the current model. This are known limitations of the current model. The cli access will not allow to have an \"unlocked\" state. It could be accomplished by opening an interactive session. But this would introduce the need to replicate most of the logic in keepassxc-browser integration (create a service). Which is quite extensive, and in this case would make no sense to replicate existing work, would be better to implement the browser integration client. The cli , offers a very clean, easy and safe access that decouples \u00c1sbr\u00fa from becoming a security target for command injections, etc. The main impact is visible if you decide to setup a keepass database with version 4+ and add a very strong encryption. This will create a delay of up to 5 seconds to unlock the database on every connection. Is your decision to balance the time to unlock and level of encryption If you are willing to wait the 5 seconds of unlock time for a connection then is OK, you decide. Why don't you implement the browser integration? Perhaps in the future it could be possible. And the current implementation would be ready to do so. But as of this date (2020-03-12), the \u00c1sbr\u00fa project, is still recovering from the hard migration to gkt3 and there are many features and stability issues that need to be addressed. This was the must balanced path to deliver a good integration and attend all other issues. Why did you have to rewrite and brake compatibility? The functionality was completely rewritten to address several related requests and additional issues detected in the previous implementation. Current Implementation Is no longer required to save the database Master Password inside \u00c1sbr\u00fa configuration files. If password is not stored, it will ask for it when needed only once, and saved in memory for the current \u00c1sbr\u00fa session. User names and passwords are retrieved from database on the fly at the moment of connection. You can change your passwords in your database and in the next connection the new one will be used. No unencrypted passwords, users, database are retained in memory or files any more. User name and passwords are references now. KeePass Url entry, can be used as a reference to get the host to connect to. User has complete control over what \u00c1sbr\u00fa should access and not. User can migrate databases versions freely without any need to wait for \u00c1sbr\u00fa to catch up. Users can use a keyfile to unlock the database.

Access You can always access your connections from the connection tree, or right clicking on the system tray. Audible Bell : Produce a sound when the terminal wants to send a bell event. (Not available in all vte versions) Confirm chains selection / execution : * pending Skip first Chain expect : Ignore the first event sent by terminals, normally is an empty command sent to expect aware applications. Prevent F11 from going full screen : Disable F11 full screen option. Use login shell to start connections : This is not necessary in general. But it can be used if your terminals behave in an unexpected way for the lack of Environment variables available.","title":"Terminal Advanced Settings"},{"location":"Manual/Preferences/TermLookAndFeel/","text":"Look & Feel Global Settings This options apply to all terminals. If you need a particular terminal to behave differently is best to configure the look and feel options at the connection level. Start terminal maximized : If the new launched terminal window or tabbed window should be maximized. Show status bar on every terminal : Add extra information and buttons at the bottom of the termina. Change main window title with terminal title : Sets the main window (tabs window) title with the title from the selected terminal tab. Password Managers Changing the main window title with the current selected Tab, is useful with some password applications (like KeePassXC), that uses the main title window to execute auto typing sequences. Example of a terminal windows with a status bar. Example of terminal window without the status bar. Show MACROS : Show access to local macros configured in a terminal Never : Do not show configured macros. In combobox : Show as a selection box, recommended when you have a long list. As buttons : Recommended when you have a very short list of macros. Show GLOBAL commands in terminal : Add the local and global commands to the list of available macros. Example macros as buttons Example macros as list Tabs : Define colors for tabs depending on their terminal current state. Set the position to locate the tabs. Terminal UI Text color : Default color for text. Back color : Default background color for terminal. Bold color : Default bold color Bold is Also bright : show bold text as bright text too. (Not available in all vterm versions) Same as text : show bold text as normal default text, no distinction Font : Set the font and size for all terminals. Cursor shape : Cursor shape to use in the terminal. Scrollback lines : How many lines of history to store to scroll back. Transparency : Set background transparency for the terminal. You must enable transparency first to activate the transparency feature. Colors : Set your predefined colors to override the basic 16 terminal colors. Top row are the normal text colors. Bottom row are the bold text colors. Transparency Transparency is not a feature , the transparency feature was removed from the Vte library. And to provide the so desired visual effect , a hack into the code had to be applied to make it work. The conclusion is that it will consume more CPU resources. The reason is that the full window is made transparent, and the the visible areas that have to be visible, repainted. Depending on your environment, the impact could be minimal or high. There are too many things in an environment to list, but this are some of them: screen resolution (the higher the resolution, more pixels to repaint) desktop environment performance : gnome-shell, gnome-classic, cinnamon, xfce, etc. Additional visual effects used in \u00c1sbr\u00fa: show tooltips.
